## Some sentences, some power

Life is like rain, it seems beautiful, but more often than not, you have to endure the cold and dampness, the helplessness and loneliness, and live with the fantasy of a sunny day.

May all those who are confused in life can find the strength to move towards the future in the voice of those who came before them

```
Mae West:
You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough

Abraham Lincoln:
The best way to predict your future is to create it

Jane Fonda:
It's never too late - never too late to start over, never to late to be happy

Dolly Parton:
Love is something sent from heaven to worry the hell out of you.

```
